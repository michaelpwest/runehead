RuneHead was released in 2005 and until 2018 was the main free service for any RuneScape clan who wanted to compile a list of their members. The service would allow you to add a list of your clan members, using their RuneScape username. Once a day RuneHead would automatically update skill statistics for each clan member and provide overall clan averages. Each clan memberlist was customizable with a custom banner, styles, and colors.
